# BUBBLE-01: Definitions

We define a **Bitcoin Beach-Like Effort (BBLE)** to be a real-life endeavor to create a circular Bitcoin economy in a particular geographic region.

By **real-life**, we mean the endeavor should take place in meatspace: in a _real_ physical community with _real_ people. Digital circular Bitcoin economies are important too, but BUBBLE guidelines are intended to be applied to real-life communities.

By **circular bitcoin economy**, we mean a marketplace of goods and services in which merchants and consumers use bitcoin as the medium of exchange. 

By bitcoin, we mean **bitcoin-only**, not "crypto". It is critical that a BBLE remain focused on adopting and understanding of bitcoin.

There are no formal restrictions on the attributes of the **geographic region**. The region can be anywhere, be of any size, and consist of people from any demographic.
