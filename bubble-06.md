# BUBBLE-06: Funding

Any effort to build a circular Bitcoin economy is going to require (at a minimum) lots of time and lots of labor, so it will also require external funding.

BBLEs should determine a budget for their efforts and where to source funding.

## Guiding Questions

- What does the budget for your project look like? How much money do you need, how often, and for what purposes?
- Where can you source this money?
- Is there anything you can do to make your project more financially sustainable over time?

## Remarks

The Bitcoin Beach project had very humble beginnings, but with a lot of hard work (and some luck/providence) it was able to attract a visionary donor with low time-preference as well as influential bitcoiners willing to share its story. It built a highly cohesive & collaborative team, which made it an easier sell for donors (compared to, for example, one guy doing everything himself); it was open-minded about the kind of help it sought (money in addition to in-kind contributions like talent and time); and it didn't make hunting for money its top priority (instead, relentless progress on the mission naturally attracted resources).

But greater financial sustainability can be indirect, too. Bitcoin Beach intentionally promoted tourism to El Zonte in order to attract more people to the town, drive local business, drive Bitcoin adoption, and get attention in world media. In the process, some people were convinced to contribute money and time to the project.
