# BUBBLE-04: Traction

A BBLE needs a solid plan to achieve traction, especially in the beginning. 

At a minimum, there should be: a singular focus, a thoughtful approach to education, and appropriate assistance initiatives to help people get comfortable with their new tools.

In the end, even the best plans don't play out perfectly, so project leaders should be ready to adapt when reality veers from the plan.

## Guiding Ideas

### Focus

What is one initiative the project will focus on? It's easy to get over-ambitious and come up with multiple, but there should be one top-priority initiative to guide early resources.

- What is the one defining initiative of the project, to start? What makes it more important than everything else?
- What kind of impact will it have? How many people will it impact?
- Who will lead it?
- What's the budget? How can funding be obtained?

### Education

Regardless of who your project targets and how it goes about promoting bitcoin adoption, at some point, you will need to educate people about bitcoin and how to use it.

- Who does it makes sense to target first for your educational efforts? What role do they play in your top-priority project?
- Why would people use Bitcoin? Are there any circumstance-specific benefits Bitcoin provides? What is the value-add for the people you're targeting? How is Bitcoin significantly better than what these people are currently using?
- How will you be interacting with people to onboard them? In-person meetings, how often, etc?
- What's the simplest possible way you can show people bitcoin, to start? Remember you can always layer more advanced concepts over time.
- Is there any way you can spark a wave of momentum to multiply your efforts? Examples: teaching kids so they teach their parents, onboarding merchants to attract other merchants, etc.
- How will you address common concerns? Volatility? Legality? Lack of state control? Custody?

### Assistance

No matter how good your education efforts are, people will be nervous at first, and they will probably need some special short-term assistance as they get comfortable with bitcoin.
  
- How can users reach you when they need help and you're not there to help them?
- Is there any way to provide early users a way to exchange earned bitcoin for local fiat currency? Perhaps through an ATM or other methods? It may seem counterintuitive, but Hope House found that having more readily-available options to convert bitcoin to fiat makes people more likely to hold bitcoin (instead of converting it at the first chance they get).
- Could cash-back programs improve confidence for your first users? Either as a way to cushion volatility, or as an incentive for businesses to accept bitcoin?

## Remarks

### Focus

Although Bitcoin Beach has grown to run a number of programs over the years, it started very humbly and very simply: just getting together with kids in the street to talk, listen, and play.

### Geography

In order for a Bitcoin circular economy to have impact, it must create a network effect.  It is much more effective to have one neighborhood in which 10 out of 20 local businesses are accepting bitcoin than it is to have dozens of businesses accepting bitcoin scattered miles apart. It is best to start focused on a small area and let the movement expand naturally from there.

### Education

Bitcoin Beach found that nothing beat _showing_ kids how to use bitcoin in the _simplest_ possible way _in-person_.

- It was overkill to explain the concepts underlying Bitcoin, holding your own keys, etc. People need to do their first transaction and have a "lightbulb" moment before they will be willing to put in the effort required to understand Bitcoin.
- It helps to showcase concepts experienced users take for granted. An example: showing a transaction between 2 different wallets to illustrate Bitcoin's openness as a protocol versus a closed corporate service like PayPal.
- Kids can pick up new technology up relatively quickly, and they're the best teachers for their parents. They are also in the best position to benefit from the mindset shifts bitcoin enables (importance of saving and investing, long time preference, etc).
- The Bitcoin Beach team makes it a point to do virtually all of their interactions in-person. Onboarding sessions are often done in the form of meetups with ~50 families where community leaders do a quick introduction about bitcoin, get people to download a wallet to their phone, send them some bitcoin, have them do a transaction of their own, and then answer questions on-the-spot.

Bitcoin Beach also used region-specific circumstances to connect to people:

- In more collectivist societies like Latin America, it can be challenging to save money because there is an expectation that you will loan or give cash on hand to family and friends with immediate need. Many people don't have bank accounts, so people often store value in ways that are not very efficient (cement blocks for future building projects, a car, rims for a car, etc) to preserve their wealth. Bitcoin provides a robust alternative for preserving wealth.
- Bitcoin enables greater physical safety as it enables people to send and receive money without carrying around cash.
- Many vendors in El Zonte don't have the resources to accept traditional electronic payments, but they do have mobile phones to easily accept bitcoin and Lightning payments.

### Assistance

El Zonte is a fairly small town, so it was feasible for the Bitcoin Beach team to make itself available for people to simply drop in with questions about using bitcoin. While this is logistically hard to accommodate, it's the most effective way of providing support.

At first, Bitcoin Beach tried a few programs to help the community build confidence in Bitcoin. They offered merchants a 20% cash-back incentive for accepting bitcoin, provided a cushion for volatility, and provided a way for people to exchange bitcoin for fiat. Although these programs were short-lived, they were critical to building consumer and merchant confidence in the concept of bitcoin as money.
