# BUBBLE-03: Team

Generally, traditional factors like professional background and education matter less than a person's relationships with their community.

Having community leaders with deep knowledge and connection to their community makes it more likely that Bitcoin-related efforts effectively address real community needs. Outsiders coming in to impose initiatives they _think_ are most needed are unlikely to bring about long-term impact (with or without Bitcoin).

Changing the money one bases their life on is a massive leap of faith, which is itself made of many smaller leaps of faith: adopting new mindsets, using new apps, doing new things, meeting new people, learning new things, etc. It is crucial that these leaps be encouraged by highly-trusted people.

## Guiding Questions

1. How much experience do community leaders have helping the community they seek to impact?
2. How strong is the bond of trust between community members and community leaders?
3. How well do community leaders understand the challenges facing their community?
4. Are community leaders well-positioned to address those challenges? Are there other people or other organizations who could help?
5. Has anyone in the same region tried a similar initiative in the past?
6. What are your personal goals in launching such an initiative? Do you think they align with those of others on your team?
7. How can you ensure that the whole project isn't reliant on one person? What can you actively do to distribute knowledge and responsibilities to others?

## Remarks

While BBLEs have sprung up all over the world and been founded by all kinds of people, there is a pattern: the leaders of these initiatives spent years selflessly bettering the lives of their target communities before Bitcoin ever entered the picture.

The leaders of Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte—Mike Peterson, Jorge Valenzuela, Roman Martinez, and Hirvin Palma—had already been involved in youth empowerment and community enrichment efforts through an effort called Hope House. They had tirelessly worked to improve the lives of El Zonte's kids and their families for several years before Bitcoin Beach ever kicked off. As a result, the Bitcoin Beach leaders knew their community better than anyone else. And, just as importantly, the bond (and trust) between Bitcoin Beach leaders and their community was strong from the start too.

Bitcoin Beach has focused on distributing knowledge and responsibilities among its team members, so the project almost never has to depend on one person for anything. They say: "it doesn’t matter who does the work—it matters more that the work is done." There's a strong culture of team members openly sharing knowledge on a regular basis, delegating work, believing in each other, trusting each other, and training younger folks to carry the mantle. This helps day-to-day operations go smoothly, for sure, but it also makes the case for others to contribute time and money more compelling too.
